The solution focuses on two main areas: ensuring dependency compatibility and clearing the Expo cache.

**1. Verify and Update Dependencies:**

First, check your `package.json`. Ensure the React Native and Expo SDK versions are compatible with your installed Expo CLI version.  Use the Expo documentation or the Expo CLI's version checking mechanism to check for compatibility and update packages if needed.

```javascript
npm install expo-cli@latest  //Install latest version 
npm install  // update other packages
```

**2. Clear Expo Cache:**

If dependency versions seem correct, the issue might be a corrupted Expo cache. Clear the cache using the following command:

```bash
expo prebuild --clean
```

**3. Restart the project:**

After clearing the cache, restart the development server.   The error should be resolved.

**4. (Advanced) Check Environment Variables:**

In rare cases, environment variables might interfere. Double check for any conflicting environment variables used by Expo.

If the problem persists after these steps, provide details about your project's dependencies, Expo CLI version, and the exact error message you're receiving.
