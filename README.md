# Expo CLI: Unexpected Errors - Version Mismatch and Cache Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered with the Expo CLI: unexpected errors stemming from version mismatches between the CLI itself, the project's dependencies (React Native, Expo SDK), and corrupted local cache files.

## Problem

The Expo CLI might throw cryptic errors if:

1.  Your project uses older React Native or Expo SDK versions incompatible with the latest Expo CLI.
2.  Expo's cache is corrupted, leading to build failures.

This issue manifests in unexpected errors during `expo start` or `expo build`.  The error messages might not directly indicate the root cause.

## Solution

The solution involves checking and resolving dependency conflicts and clearing the Expo cache.  See the `expoBugSolution.js` for a breakdown of the steps.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2.  Attempt to run `expo start`. You may (or may not) see the error depending on your environment.  To increase the likelihood of the error, create a mismatch between your expo version and your package.json dependencies. For example use an older SDK version that is not compatible with your CLI version. 
3.  Follow the steps in `expoBugSolution.js` to resolve the issue.
