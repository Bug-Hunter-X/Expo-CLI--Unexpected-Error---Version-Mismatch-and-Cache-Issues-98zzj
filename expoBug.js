This error typically occurs when you have a mismatch between the versions of Expo CLI and the dependencies specified in your project's package.json.  For example, you might be using a newer Expo CLI version that's incompatible with older React Native or Expo SDK versions.

**Example:** If your project relies on an older Expo SDK version that doesn't support a feature introduced in a newer Expo CLI, you'll encounter this issue.  The CLI might try to use features your project doesn't understand causing an unexpected error.

Another cause could be corrupted cache files related to Expo CLI.  The CLI relies on cached data and if this data becomes corrupted, it could lead to errors during build processes.
